{"name":"2014","tagline":"Kof's sketchbook 2014","body":"#2014\r\n\r\nKof's sketchbook year 2014, build with [Processing](http://processing.org) software.\r\n\r\nThe sketches are organized by months of year. This structure can make a feel of a superior organization, which in fact is false, it is rather mess with all ideas and unfinished concepts placed in kind of plain time-line space. Feel free to dig in and recycle anything useful for you.. when you find something like this, do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n##Sketches Running On-line\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of selection hosted on [Open Processing](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/3942), these are mostly a bit *obsolete* Java applets selected for being able to run in a browser.\r\n\r\n##Rendered Outputs\r\n\r\nOther way of on-line presentation is quite heavily re-compressed (h264) videos, they are more widely accepted due to more \"standard media form\". The most of these outputs are available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/kof/videos).\r\n\r\n##Archival Code Bits and Pieces\r\n\r\nIf you really feel like digging, there are more historical *pieces*. To travel back in time in repositories:\r\n\r\n* [2013](https://github.com/K0F/2013)\r\n* [2012](https://github.com/K0F/2012)\r\n* [2011](https://github.com/K0F/2011)\r\n* [2010](https://github.com/K0F/2010)\r\n* [2009](https://github.com/K0F/2009)\r\n* [2008](https://github.com/K0F/2008)\r\n* [2007](https://github.com/K0F/2007)\r\n\r\nBut please, remember you had been warned, there is plenty of code with very varying *qualities* .. to be more exact, some of programs are complete waste of time to run or even compile ))\r\n\r\n\r\n*Enjoy, and feel free to recycle!*\r\n\r\n*-- kof*\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
